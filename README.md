## About

This project was developed as part of my thesis, and it leverages the simplicity and speed of CodeIgniter to build a reliable web application. The goal of this project is to provide a fast, lightweight, and scalable solution for web development.

## Technologies

- **CodeIgniter**: The core PHP framework used for the application.
- **PHP >= 5.3.7**: The minimum required PHP version for running this application.
- **PHPUnit**: Used for unit testing.
- **vfsStream**: Virtual file system used for unit testing.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Install the dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Ensure that your PHP version is **5.3.7** or higher. You can check your PHP version by running:
